# oop.crud_editor
lab4. Object Oriented Programming. CRUD editor made by reflection. There are three types of serialization to choose from: binary, json and my own type. There is nothing unique about it. This is the same json but written by myself. Also there are two plugins: .zip and .gz archivers. They are made for post processing and uploading archived data.
